# Healthy Code Workshop

## Introduction

The goal of this game development tech workshop is to help programmers learn, grow, and form good habits. We're here to look beyond the daily issues of "Why is this not working?!" and instead focus on reducing the *frequency* of those "Why?!" moments through long term education and growth.

The organizers of the workshop are [Jonas BÃ¶tel](https://twitter.com/codelumpn) and [Johnson Lin](https://twitter.com/igdshare). The workshop will be held in both English and Traditional Chinese simultaneously.
